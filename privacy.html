  <p>
    BabyBlend AI (“we”, “us”, “our”) provides an application that generates baby or toddler images based on user-provided photos.
    We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

  <h3>1.1 Photos You Upload</h3>
  <p>
    You may upload one or two face images for the purpose of generating AI-processed baby photos.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Photos are transmitted securely to our servers.</li>
    <li>Photos are used only for generating results and are not used to train AI models.</li>
    <li>Photos may be temporarily stored for processing but are automatically deleted after the generation process is completed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>1.2 Generated Images</h3>
  <p>
    We generate baby or toddler images based on your inputs. The generated images are returned to your device.
    They may be stored temporarily on our servers to deliver your results but are not used for any other purpose.

  <h3>1.3 Technical Information</h3>
  <p>
    We may collect certain technical and usage data automatically, such as:

    <li>Anonymous usage statistics (e.g., which features are used, basic session data),</li>
    <li>Error and crash logs.</li>

  <p>
    This data is typically collected through third-party tools such as Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics.

    <li>To analyze usage and fix technical issues (crashes, bugs),</li>
    <li>To manage subscriptions and premium features,</li>
    <li>To respond to user support requests.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We do <strong>not</strong> sell your personal data or your photos to advertisers. We do not use your uploaded images to train AI models.
  </p>
